# Jekyll-Photo-Gallery
With Jekyll-Photo-Gallery you can easily generate a photo gallery for your Jekyll site or blog.
Jekyll-Photo-Gallery generates a static index and a page for every photo based on the layouts photoIndex.html and photo.html.
These layouts can be easily adapted to fit the style of your site. The photo layout is also automatically enriched with metadata 
such as photo location (Google Maps), ISO, F and speed values.  
The whole plugin is setup so that new photos can be added with minimal effort. Thumbnails are automatically generated with ImageMagick on macOS and Linux. (It may work on windows as well, 
but you need to find out how to install ImageMagick yourself.)

# Known bugs & limitations

**1. Fixed order in detail view:**  
Atm every photo detail page contains its "previous picture" & "next picture" information. So even though you can change
the order of pictures in a gallery via JS, when you load a detail view and click next the original next picture will be displayed.
This also means that if you're in a album and you click on next in the detail view of the last picture it will go to the next picture
regardless if that picture is in the album.

**2. Only one album per photo:**  
Right now a photo can only be in one album at a time.

**3. Why are you including the CSS files in head.html as well as individual templates?**  
To make the setup easier for people who just copy the specific templates. Including them once is enough.




# Troubleshooting
If the gallery doesn't appear in your page but the files have been generated correctly then it's likely that there is a javascript error.
In order to find the problem it's best to open the javascript console on Chrome (or your browser of choice) and to reload the page. If there's an error
it will now appear in the console output.

**1. Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined:**  
This error happens when jQuery wasn't loaded before executing the gallery script. Make sure that your templates has the jQuery includes.

**2. The gallery isn't justified, the thumbnails are in a vertical line:**  
Be sure to include the CSS files "justifiedGallery.min.css" and "jekyll-photo-gallery.css" in the template where you're using the gallery. If you're embedding the gallery
in a post the template of the post also has to include these CSS files.
